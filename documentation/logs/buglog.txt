11:50: I've encountered a whitelabel 500 error while trying to view the page. [1]
11:55: I've located a misspelling in the html file, there was a missing "}" in the reference for one of the buttons. The bug has been resolved [1]
13:15: Pressing the "Add Employee" button returns a 404 error. [2]
13:20: The reference link in the button was referencing the wrong method. Whilst resolving the issue I've noticed that the submit button is not appearing. [2] [3]

13:25: Pressing submit returns a 404 error [4]
13:30: There was a misspelling in the mapping for the method. The bug has been resolved [4]
14:55: Pressing the button to delete an employee returns a 405 error stating that GET is the wrong method. Even though the buttons specifies POST as its method. [5]
