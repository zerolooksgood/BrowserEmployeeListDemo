(1) explaining the database url:
jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/employeeDemo
"jdbc:postgresql" is the driver that we're using to connect to the database.
"localhost" means that the database is on out local computer.
":5432" is the chosen port, this is the standard port for postgres.
"/employeeDemo" is the name of the database that I'm using.

(2) marking class as an entity:
Marking a class as an entity essentially means that you're telling spring-data-jpa (which is what handles the communication between the database and the application) that this object is a linked to a table. This basically converts the database table rows to a java class format

(3) JPA-repository:
JPA-repository is a DAO (data access object) that allows communication between the database and the application. JPA Repository also comes with many built-in features, too many for me to explain here.

(4) Model:
The Model is a special class that we can use to share information from a java file to an associated .html file.
